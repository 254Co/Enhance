Embeddings are dense vector representations of data (often text) that capture semantic relationships. Pre-trained embeddings can be used to represent words, sentences, or documents as continuous-valued feature vectors.

Application:

	•	Natural language processing
	•	Semantic similarity tasks

Example:
In text classification tasks, word embeddings (like those from Word2Vec or BERT) can convert text into feature vectors that preserve semantic meaning, improving the performance of classifiers.

These deep learning methods enhance feature engineering by automating the discovery of complex patterns and relationships within data, leading to more informative and effective features for predictive modeling.
