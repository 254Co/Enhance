RNNs and LSTMs are designed to handle sequential data, capturing temporal dependencies and patterns over time. They can generate features that encapsulate the dynamic behavior of the data.

Application:

	•	Time-series data
	•	Sequential data analysis

Example:
For financial time-series data, an LSTM network can create features that summarize historical trends and patterns, which can then be used to predict future movements.
