Autoencoders are neural networks that learn to compress data into a lower-dimensional representation and then reconstruct it. The encoded representation can serve as a set of learned features that capture the essential information in the data.

Application:

	•	Dimensionality reduction
	•	Anomaly detection
	•	Noise reduction

Example:
In a dataset with high-dimensional features, an autoencoder can reduce the dimensionality while preserving important information, making it easier for downstream models to process and learn from the data.
