While primarily known for generating synthetic data, GANs can also be used for feature engineering by creating new, meaningful representations of the input data through the adversarial training process.

Application:

	•	Data augmentation
	•	Creating new feature spaces

Example:
In a dataset with limited diversity, a GAN can generate new data points that introduce variability and improve the robustness of features used by other models.
